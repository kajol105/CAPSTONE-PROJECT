This project focused on predicting employee promotions using SQL, Python, and Power BI. 
SQL was used to organize data, including employee details like department, education, and performance metrics.
Python's Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped uncover patterns and clean the data. We then built a classification model to predict promotions based on features like KPIs_met >80%, awards won, avg_training_score. 
In last, a Power BI dashboard presented our findings clearly. 
This structured approach provided actionable insights for HR department to make informed decisions regarding employee promotions![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b94f3bef-6d86-42e3-827b-a51c898e0612)
